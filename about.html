                <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
                <p>
                    At HearMe, we provide a safe space for students to understand and manage their mental health. Our platform offers a self-assessment quiz 
                    to help you recognize signs of stress, anxiety, or other challenges. We also provide helpful resources on common mental health
                    issues, practical coping strategies, and ways to seek support. Whether you need quick tips, encouragement, or someone to 
                    talk to, we’re here to help. <br><br>
                    We integrate humanity with science by using mental health education, an evidence-based method, to empower people’s understanding of 
                    their own and others’ physical and mental wellbeing. Through lectures, discussions, and practice people build up a repertoire of 
                    positive coping mechanisms, rendering them better at dealing with current stressors and more resilient to future ones.

                <h3>OUR VISION</h3>
                <p>HearMe envisions a world where mental health education is integrated into all community centers, schools and companies with 
                    the aim to prevent and reduce mental illness. This vision is two-fold: HearMe envisions a world where an individual 
                    has the general knowledge to understand their feelings, thoughts and sensations from a personal and scientific perspective. 
                    In parallel, we envision a world where the community (friends, family, community centers) can serve as reliable support for 
                    individuals struggling with mental illness. HearMe envisions this world to rely on evidence-based methods, including 
                    technology, education, and group-activities, to continuously support individuals and communities thrive.
